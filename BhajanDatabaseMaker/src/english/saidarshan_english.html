<LI>Without singing to the Lord, there's no peace or happiness <br>
Without praising His Name, there's no feeling of bliss <br>
With no love and devotion, we never will be free <br>
Without service to Him, no salvation can there be <br>
Without serving mankind, no salvation can there be <br>
Without singing to the Lord, there's no peace or happiness <br>
We find union with Him When our minds are at rest <br>
The best wisdom is seeing the Lord everywhere <br>
The most righteous of deeds shows compassion and care <br>
There is no one as near and as dear as the Lord <br>
He is present in all and in all can be adored <br>

May we see the light <br>
May we know ever after <br>
Love in our sight <br>
May our hearts fly to meet You <br>
May our eyes see <br>
May our love break its bondage <br>
And make us free <br>
